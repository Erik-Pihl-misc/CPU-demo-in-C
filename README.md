# CPU demo in C
Demonstrates how an 8-bit CPU works in a terminal environment. 
Based on microcontroller ATmega328P.

The instruction set constitutes of a subset of the Atmel AVR instruction set. 
Includes data memory, program memory, stack and pin change interrupts.

Contains files to be opened as a complete project in Visual Studio 2022.
